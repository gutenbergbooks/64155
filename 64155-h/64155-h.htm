<p>“Mr. Clark manifests what is an innate perception of what is likely to be useful in a pocket
book, and he is really unrivalled in the art of condensation. It is very difficult to hit upon any
mechanical engineering subject concerning which this work supplies no information, and the
excellent index at the end adds to its utility. In one word, it is an exceedingly handy and efficient
tool, possessed of which the engineer will be saved many a wearisome calculation, or yet more
wearisome hunt through various text-books and treatises, and, as such, we can heartily recommend
it to our readers.”—<i>The Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“It would be found difficult to compress more matter within a similar compass, or produce a
book of 650 pages which should be more compact or convenient for pocket reference.... Will
be appreciated by mechanical engineers of all classes.”—<i>Practical Engineer.</i></p>

<h3>THE WORKS’ MANAGER’S HANDBOOK.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Comprising Modern Rules, Tables, and Data. For Engineers, Millwrights,
and Boiler Makers; Tool Makers, Machinists, and Metal Workers; Iron and
Brass Founders, &amp;c. By <span class="smcap">W. S. Hutton</span>, Civil and Mechanical Engineer,
Author of “The Poetical Engineer’s Handbook.” Sixth Edition, carefully
Revised, with Additions. In One handsome Volume, medium 8vo, strongly
bound.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smaller">[<i>Just Published.</i></span> <b>15/0</b></p>

</div>

<p>☞ <i>The Author having compiled Rules and Data for his own use in a great
variety of modern engineering work, and having found his notes extremely useful,
decided to publish them—revised to date—believing that a practical work, suited to
the <span class="smcap">daily requirements of modern engineers</span>, would be favourably received</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Of this edition we may repeat the appreciative remarks we made upon the first and third.
Since the appearance of the latter very considerable modifications have been made, although the
total number of pages remains almost the same. It is a very useful collection of rules, tables, and
workshop and drawing office data.”—<i>The Engineer</i>, May 10, 1895.</p>

<p>“The author treats every subject from the point of view of one who has collected workshop
notes for application in workshop practice, rather than from the theoretical or literary aspect. The
volume contains a great deal of that kind of information which is gained only by practical experience,
and is seldom written in books.”—<i>The Engineer</i>, June 5, 1885.</p>

<p>“The volume is an exceedingly useful one, brimful with engineer’s notes, memoranda, and
rules, and well worthy of being on every mechanical engineer’s bookshelf.”—<i>Mechanical World.</i></p>

<p>“The information is precisely that likely to be required in practice.... The work forms
a desirable addition to the library not only of the works’ manager, but of any one connected with
general engineering.”—<i>Mining Journal.</i></p>

<p>“Brimful of useful information, stated in concise form, Mr. Hutton’s books have met a
pressing want among engineers. The book must prove extremely useful to every practical man
possessing a copy.”—<i>Practical Engineer.</i></p>

</div>

<p>☞ <i>This Work is designed as a companion to the Author’s</i> “<span class="smcap">Works’
Manager’s Handbook</span>.” <i>It possesses many new and original features, and contains,
like its predecessor, a quantity of matter not originally intended for publication,
but collected by the Author for his own use in the construction of a great variety of</i>
<span class="smcap">Modern Engineering Work</span>.</p>

<p><i>The information is given in a condensed and concise form, and is illustrated by
upwards of 370 Woodcuts; and comprises a quantity of tabulated matter of great
value to all engaged in designing, constructing, or estimating for <span class="smcap">Engines</span>, <span class="smcap">Boilers</span>,
and <span class="smcap">other Engineering Work</span>.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“We have kept it at hand for several weeks, referring to it as occasion arose, and we have not
on a single occasion consulted its pages without finding the information of which we were in quest.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“A thoroughly good practical handbook, which no engineer can go through without learning
something that will be of service to him.”—<i>Marine Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“An excellent book of reference for engineers, and a valuable text-book for students of
engineering.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“This valuable manual embodies the results and experience of the leading authorities on
mechanical engineering.”—<i>Building News.</i></p>

<p>“The author has collected together a surprising quantity of rules and practical data, and has
shown much judgment in the selections he has made.... There is no doubt that this book is
one of the most useful of its kind published, and will be a very popular compendium.”—<i>Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“A mass of information set down in simple language, and in such a form that it can be easily
referred to at any time. The matter is uniformly good and well chosen, and is greatly elucidated
by the illustrations. The book will find its way on to most engineers’ shelves, where it will rank as
one of the most useful books of reference.”—<i>Practical Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“Full of useful information, and should be found on the office shelf of all practical engineers.”—<i>English
Mechanic.</i></p>

<h3>STEAM BOILER CONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A Practical Handbook for Engineers, Boiler-Makers, and Steam Users.
Containing a large Collection of Rules and Data relating to Recent Practice
in the Design, Construction, and Working of all Kinds of Stationary, Locomotive,
and Marine Steam-Boilers. By <span class="smcap">Walter S. Hutton</span>, Civil and
Mechanical Engineer, Author of “The Works’ Manager’s Handbook,” “The
Practical Engineer’s Handbook,” &amp;c. With upwards of 500 Illustrations.
Third Edition, Revised and much Enlarged, medium 8vo, cloth</p>

<p class="right"><b>18/0</b></p>

</div>

<p>☞ <span class="smcap">This Work</span> <i>is issued in continuation of the Series of Handbooks written
by the Author, viz.</i>:—“<span class="smcap">The Works’ Manager’s Handbook</span>” <i>and</i> “<span class="smcap">The Practical
Engineer’s Handbook</span>,” <i>which are so highly appreciated by engineers for the
practical nature of their information; and is consequently written in the same style
as those works</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Author believes that the concentration, in a convenient form for easy
reference, of such a large amount of thoroughly practical information on Steam-Boilers,
will be of considerable service to those for whom it is intended, and he trusts
the book may be deemed worthy of as favourable a reception as has been accorded to
its predecessors.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“One of the best, if not the best, books on boilers that has ever been published. The information
is of the right kind, in a simple and accessible form. So far as generation is concerned, this
is, undoubtedly, the standard book on steam practice.”—<i>Electrical Review.</i></p>

<p>“Every detail, both in boiler design and management, is clearly laid before the reader. The
volume shows that boiler construction has been reduced to the condition of one of the most exact
sciences; and such a book is of the utmost value to the <i>fin de siècle</i> Engineer and Works Manager.”—<i>Marine
Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“There has long been room for a modern handbook on steam boilers; there is not that room
now, because Mr. Hutton has filled it. It is a thoroughly practical book for those who are occupied
in the construction, design, selection, or use of boilers.”—<i>Engineer.</i></p>

<p>“The book is of so important and comprehensive a character that it must find its way into the
libraries of every one interested in boiler using or boiler manufacture if they wish to be thoroughly
informed. We strongly recommend the book for the intrinsic value of its contents.”—<i>Machinery
Market.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“In its modernised form Hutton’s ‘Templeton’ should have a wide sale, for it contains much
valuable information which the mechanic will often find of use, and not a few tables and notes which
he might look for in vain in other works. This modernised edition will be appreciated by all who
have learned to value the original editions of ‘Templeton.’”—<i>English Mechanic.</i></p>

<p>“It has met with great success in the engineering workshop, as we can testify; and there are
a great many men who, in a great measure, owe their rise in life to this little book.”—<i>Building
News.</i></p>

<p>“This familiar text-book—well known to all mechanics and engineers—is of essential service
to the every-day requirements of engineers, millwrights, and the various trades connected with

News.</i> (Second Notice.)</p>

<p>“This well-known and largely-used book contains information, brought up to date, of the
sort so useful to the foreman and draughtsman. So much fresh information has been introduced as
to constitute it practically a new book. It will be largely used in the office and workshop.”—<i>Mechanical
World.</i></p>

<p>“The publishers wisely entrusted the task of revision of this popular, valuable, and useful
book to Mr. Hutton, than whom a more competent man they could not have found.”—<i>Iron.</i></p>

<p>“A valuable and lucid summary of recent astronomical theory, rendered more valuable and
attractive by a series of stellar photographs and other illustrations.”—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“In presenting a clear and concise account of the present state of our knowledge Mr. Gore
has made a valuable addition to the literature of the subject.”—<i>Nature.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Gore’s ‘Visible Universe’ is one of the finest works on astronomical science that have
recently appeared in our language. In spirit and in method it is scientific from cover to cover, but
the style is so clear and attractive that it will be as acceptable and as readable to those who make
no scientific pretensions as to those who devote themselves specially to matters astronomical.”—<i>Leeds

pomp’ of the heavens nothing could be better than a set of delineations averaging scarcely twenty
square inches in area and including nothing that cannot at once be identified.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Dr. Fream is to be congratulated on the successful attempt he has made to give us a work
which will at once become the standard classic of the farm practice of the country. We believe
that it will be found that it has no compeer among the many works at present in existence....
The illustrations are admirable, while the frontispiece, which represents the well-known bull,
New Year’s Gift, owned by the Queen, is a work of art.”—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“The book must be recognised as occupying the proud position of the most exhaustive work
of reference in the English language on the subject with which it deals.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“The most comprehensive guide to modern farm practice that exists in the English language
to-day.... The book is one that ought to be on every farm and in the library of every land
owner.”—<i>Mark Lane Express.</i></p>

<p>“In point of exhaustiveness and accuracy the work will certainly hold a pre-eminent and
unique position among books dealing with scientific agricultural practice. It is, in fact, an agricultural
library of itself.”—<i>North British Agriculturist.</i></p>

the work of the live stock farmer; probably without an equal in this or any other country.”—<i>Yorkshire
Post.</i></p>

<p>☞ <i>The object of this work is to enable those who consult it to help themselves to the
law; and thereby to dispense, as far as possible, with professional assistance and advice. There
are many wrongs and grievances which persons submit to from time to time through not
knowing how or where to apply for redress; and many persons have as great a dread of a
lawyer’s office as of a lion’s den. With this book at hand it is believed that many a <span class="smcap">Six-and-Eightpence</span>
may be saved; many a wrong redressed; many a right reclaimed; many a law
suit avoided; and many an evil abated. The work has established itself as the standard legal
adviser of all classes, and has also made a reputation for itself as a useful book of reference for
lawyers residing at a distance from law libraries, who are glad to have at hand a work
embodying recent decisions and enactments.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
