    “Mr. Clark manifests what is an innate perception of what
    is likely to be useful in a pocket book, and he is really
    unrivalled in the art of condensation. It is very difficult to
    hit upon any mechanical engineering subject concerning which
    this work supplies no information, and the excellent index at
    the end adds to its utility. In one word, it is an exceedingly
    handy and efficient tool, possessed of which the engineer will
    be saved many a wearisome calculation, or yet more wearisome
    hunt through various text-books and treatises, and, as such, we
    can heartily recommend it to our readers.”—_The Engineer._

    “It would be found difficult to compress more matter within a
    similar compass, or produce a book of 650 pages which should
    be more compact or convenient for pocket reference.... Will be
    appreciated by mechanical engineers of all classes.”—_Practical
    Engineer._


MR. HUTTON’S PRACTICAL HANDBOOKS.


THE WORKS’ MANAGER’S HANDBOOK.

Comprising Modern Rules, Tables, and Data. For Engineers, Millwrights,
and Boiler Makers; Tool Makers, Machinists, and Metal Workers; Iron and
Brass Founders, &c. By W. S. HUTTON, Civil and Mechanical Engineer,
Author of “The Poetical Engineer’s Handbook.” Sixth Edition, carefully
Revised, with Additions. In One handsome Volume, medium 8vo, strongly
bound. [_Just Published._ =15/0=

☞ _The Author having compiled Rules and Data for his own use in a
great variety of modern engineering work, and having found his notes
extremely useful, decided to publish them—revised to date—believing that
a practical work, suited to the DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF MODERN ENGINEERS,
would be favourably received_.

    “Of this edition we may repeat the appreciative remarks we made
    upon the first and third. Since the appearance of the latter
    very considerable modifications have been made, although the
    total number of pages remains almost the same. It is a very
    useful collection of rules, tables, and workshop and drawing
    office data.”—_The Engineer_, May 10, 1895.

    “The author treats every subject from the point of view of one
    who has collected workshop notes for application in workshop
    practice, rather than from the theoretical or literary aspect.
    The volume contains a great deal of that kind of information
    which is gained only by practical experience, and is seldom
    written in books.”—_The Engineer_, June 5, 1885.

    “The volume is an exceedingly useful one, brimful with
    engineer’s notes, memoranda, and rules, and well worthy of
    being on every mechanical engineer’s bookshelf.”—_Mechanical
    World._

    “The information is precisely that likely to be required in
    practice.... The work forms a desirable addition to the library
    not only of the works’ manager, but of any one connected with
    general engineering.”—_Mining Journal._

    “Brimful of useful information, stated in concise form, Mr.
    Hutton’s books have met a pressing want among engineers.
    The book must prove extremely useful to every practical man
    possessing a copy.”—_Practical Engineer._


THE PRACTICAL ENGINEER’S HANDBOOK.

Comprising a Treatise on Modern Engines and Boilers, Marine, Locomotive,
and Stationary. And containing a large collection of Rules and Practical
Data relating to Recent Practice in Designing and Constructing all kinds

HUTTON, Civil and Mechanical Engineer, Author of “The Works’ Manager’s
Handbook for Engineers,” &c. With upwards of 370 Illustrations. Fifth
Edition, Revised with Additions. Medium 8vo, nearly 500 pp., strongly
bound. [_Just Published._ =18/0=

☞ _This Work is designed as a companion to the Author’s_ “WORKS’
MANAGER’S HANDBOOK.” _It possesses many new and original features, and
contains, like its predecessor, a quantity of matter not originally
intended for publication, but collected by the Author for his own use in
the construction of a great variety of_ MODERN ENGINEERING WORK.

_The information is given in a condensed and concise form, and is
illustrated by upwards of 370 Woodcuts; and comprises a quantity
of tabulated matter of great value to all engaged in designing,
constructing, or estimating for ENGINES, BOILERS, and OTHER ENGINEERING
WORK._

    “We have kept it at hand for several weeks, referring to it as
    occasion arose, and we have not on a single occasion consulted
    its pages without finding the information of which we were in
    quest.”—_Athenæum._

    “A thoroughly good practical handbook, which no engineer can go
    through without learning something that will be of service to
    him.”—_Marine Engineer._

    “An excellent book of reference for engineers, and a valuable
    text-book for students of engineering.”—_Scotsman._

    “This valuable manual embodies the results and experience of
    the leading authorities on mechanical engineering.”—_Building
    News._

    “The author has collected together a surprising quantity of
    rules and practical data, and has shown much judgment in the
    selections he has made.... There is no doubt that this book is
    one of the most useful of its kind published, and will be a
    very popular compendium.”—_Engineer._

    “A mass of information set down in simple language, and in
    such a form that it can be easily referred to at any time.
    The matter is uniformly good and well chosen, and is greatly
    elucidated by the illustrations. The book will find its way on
    to most engineers’ shelves, where it will rank as one of the
    most useful books of reference.”—_Practical Engineer._

    “Full of useful information, and should be found on the office
    shelf of all practical engineers.”—_English Mechanic._


STEAM BOILER CONSTRUCTION.

A Practical Handbook for Engineers, Boiler-Makers, and Steam Users.
Containing a large Collection of Rules and Data relating to Recent
Practice in the Design, Construction, and Working of all Kinds of
Stationary, Locomotive, and Marine Steam-Boilers. By WALTER S. HUTTON,
Civil and Mechanical Engineer, Author of “The Works’ Manager’s
Handbook,” “The Practical Engineer’s Handbook,” &c. With upwards of 500
Illustrations. Third Edition, Revised and much Enlarged, medium 8vo,
cloth =18/0=

☞ THIS WORK _is issued in continuation of the Series of Handbooks
written by the Author, viz._:—“THE WORKS’ MANAGER’S HANDBOOK” _and_
“THE PRACTICAL ENGINEER’S HANDBOOK,” _which are so highly appreciated
by engineers for the practical nature of their information; and is
consequently written in the same style as those works_.

_The Author believes that the concentration, in a convenient form
for easy reference, of such a large amount of thoroughly practical
information on Steam-Boilers, will be of considerable service to those
for whom it is intended, and he trusts the book may be deemed worthy of
as favourable a reception as has been accorded to its predecessors._

    “One of the best, if not the best, books on boilers that has
    ever been published. The information is of the right kind,
    in a simple and accessible form. So far as generation is
    concerned, this is, undoubtedly, the standard book on steam
    practice.”—_Electrical Review._

    “Every detail, both in boiler design and management, is
    clearly laid before the reader. The volume shows that boiler
    construction has been reduced to the condition of one of the
    most exact sciences; and such a book is of the utmost value
    to the _fin de siècle_ Engineer and Works Manager.”—_Marine
    Engineer._

    “There has long been room for a modern handbook on steam
    boilers; there is not that room now, because Mr. Hutton has
    filled it. It is a thoroughly practical book for those who are
    occupied in the construction, design, selection, or use of
    boilers.”—_Engineer._

    “The book is of so important and comprehensive a character that
    it must find its way into the libraries of every one interested
    in boiler using or boiler manufacture if they wish to be
    thoroughly informed. We strongly recommend the book for the
    intrinsic value of its contents.”—_Machinery Market._

upwards of 250 Illustrative Diagrams, strongly bound for workshop or
pocket wear and tear =6/0=

    “In its modernised form Hutton’s ‘Templeton’ should have a
    wide sale, for it contains much valuable information which the
    mechanic will often find of use, and not a few tables and notes
    which he might look for in vain in other works. This modernised
    edition will be appreciated by all who have learned to value
    the original editions of ‘Templeton.’”—_English Mechanic._

    “It has met with great success in the engineering workshop, as
    we can testify; and there are a great many men who, in a great
    measure, owe their rise in life to this little book.”—_Building
    News._

    “This familiar text-book—well known to all mechanics and
    engineers—is of essential service to the every-day requirements
    of engineers, millwrights, and the various trades connected
    with engineering and building. The new modernised edition is
    worth its weight in gold.”—_Building News._ (Second Notice.)

    “This well-known and largely-used book contains information,
    brought up to date, of the sort so useful to the foreman and
    draughtsman. So much fresh information has been introduced as
    to constitute it practically a new book. It will be largely
    used in the office and workshop.”—_Mechanical World._

    “The publishers wisely entrusted the task of revision of this
    popular, valuable, and useful book to Mr. Hutton, than whom a
    more competent man they could not have found.”—_Iron._

    shelves of every brewer’s library.”—_Brewers’ Guardian._

⁂ OPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON THE NEW EDITION.

    “Dr. Fream is to be congratulated on the successful attempt
    he has made to give us a work which will at once become the
    standard classic of the farm practice of the country. We
    believe that it will be found that it has no compeer among
    the many works at present in existence.... The illustrations
    are admirable, while the frontispiece, which represents the
    well-known bull, New Year’s Gift, owned by the Queen, is a work
    of art.”—_The Times._

    “The book must be recognised as occupying the proud position of
    the most exhaustive work of reference in the English language
    on the subject with which it deals.”—_Athenæum._

    exists in the English language to-day.... The book is one that
    ought to be on every farm and in the library of every land
    owner.”—_Mark Lane Express._

    “In point of exhaustiveness and accuracy the work will
    certainly hold a pre-eminent and unique position among books
    dealing with scientific agricultural practice. It is, in
    fact, an agricultural library of itself.”—_North British
    Agriculturist._

    on every conceivable branch of the work of the live stock
    farmer; probably without an equal in this or any other
    country.”—_Yorkshire Post._

    a production to be proud of, and its issue not the least of

☞ _The object of this work is to enable those who consult it to help
themselves to the law; and thereby to dispense, as far as possible, with
professional assistance and advice. There are many wrongs and grievances
which persons submit to from time to time through not knowing how or
where to apply for redress; and many persons have as great a dread of a
lawyer’s office as of a lion’s den. With this book at hand it is believed
that many a SIX-AND-EIGHTPENCE may be saved; many a wrong redressed; many
a right reclaimed; many a law suit avoided; and many an evil abated. The
work has established itself as the standard legal adviser of all classes,
and has also made a reputation for itself as a useful book of reference
for lawyers residing at a distance from law libraries, who are glad to
have at hand a work embodying recent decisions and enactments._

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
